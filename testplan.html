            <p>Before writing test cases, we need to define a test plan at the beginning, the test plan includes test scope, strategy, resource, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Test Plan</h3>
            <p>A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and resources required to perform testing for a software product. 
            Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test. The test plan serves as a blueprint to conduct software testing activities as a defined process, which is minutely monitored and controlled by the test manager.</p>
            <p>As per ISTQB definition: “Test Plan is A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities.”
            </p>
            <h3>What is the Importance of Test Plan?</h3>

                    <li>Help people outside the test team such as developers, business managers, customers understand the details of testing.</li>
                    <li>Test Plan guides our thinking. It is like a rule book, which needs to be followed.</li>
                    <li>Important aspects like test estimation, test scope, Test Strategy are documented in Test Plan, so it can be reviewed by Management Team and re-used for other projects.</li>
                </ul>
