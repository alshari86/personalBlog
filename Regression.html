                <p>Regression Testing is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features. Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases that are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Regression Testing?</h3>
                <p>There is a need for regression testing whenever the code is changed, and you need to determine whether the modified code will affect other parts of the software application. Moreover, regression testing is needed when a new feature is added to the software application. Regression tests may also be performed when a functional or performance defect/issue is fixed.</p>
                <h3>How to do Regression Testing</h3>
                <p>In order to do Regression Testing process, we need to first debug the code to identify the bugs. Once the bugs are identified, required changes are made to fix it, then the regression testing is done by selecting relevant test cases from the test suite that covers both modified and affected parts of the code.
                </p>
                <p>Software maintenance is an activity which includes enhancements, error corrections, optimization and deletion of existing features. These modifications may cause the system to work incorrectly. Therefore, Regression Testing becomes necessary. Regression Testing can be carried out using the following techniques:</p>
                <h3>Selecting test cases for regression testing</h3>
                <p>It was found from industry data that a good number of the defects reported by customers were due to last minute bug fixes creating side effects and hence selecting the Test Case for regression testing is an art and not that easy. </p>
                <div>
                    <p>Effective Regression Tests can be done by selecting the following test cases</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Test cases which have frequent defects</li>
                        <li>Functionalities which are more visible to the users</li>
                        <li>Test cases which verify core features of the product</li>
                        <li>Test cases of Functionalities which has undergone more and recent changes</li>
                        <li>All Integration Test Cases</li>
                        <li>All Complex Test Cases</li>
                        <li>Boundary value test cases</li>
