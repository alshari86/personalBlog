                <p>Software Testing Techniques help you design better test cases. Since exhaustive testing is not possible; 
                    Manual Testing Techniques help reduce the number of test cases to be executed while increasing test coverage.
                </p>
                <h3>Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)</h3>
                <p>Boundary value analysis is based on testing at the boundaries between partitions. It includes maximum, minimum, inside or outside boundaries, typical values and error values.</p>
                <p>It is generally seen that a large number of errors occur at the boundaries of the defined input values rather than the center. It is also known as BVA and gives a selection of test cases which exercise bounding values.
                </p>
                <h3>Equivalence Class Partitioning</h3>
                <p>Equivalent Class Partitioning allows you to divide set of test condition into a partition which should be considered the same. 
                    This software testing method divides the input domain of a program into classes of data from which test cases should be designed.
                </p>
                <h3>Decision Table Based Testing</h3>
                <p>A decision table is also known as to Cause-Effect table. This software testing technique is used for functions which respond to a combination of inputs or events. For example, a submit button should be enabled if the user has entered all required fields.</p>
                <p>The first task is to identify functionalities where the output depends on a combination of inputs. If there are large input set of combinations, then divide it into smaller subsets which are helpful for managing a decision table.</p>
                <p>For every function, you need to create a table and list down all types of combinations of inputs and its respective outputs. This helps to identify a condition that is overlooked by the tester.
